All dinosaurs are better than you.
Triceratops is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that first appeared during the late Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago in what is now North America. It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became extinct in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.
People have only been on Earth about 2.5 million years. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for about 160 million years, which is about 64 times longer than people been around.
Dinosaurs lived on all the continents, including Antarctica.
The earliest named dinosaur found so far is the Eoraptor (“dawn stealer”). It was so named because it once stole and ate the sun, thus creating the "Ice Age".
The dinosaur with the longest name is Micropachycephalosaurus (“small thick-headed lizard”). Its fossils are usually found in China.
Most dinosaurs were vegetarians.
Most dinosaurs were vegans, including velociraptors and egoraptors.
Dinosaurs that could run on two legs were called bipeds. Dinosaurs that could run on four legs were called quadriplegic.
Birds are also dinosaurs. Isn't that so cool!?
Palentologists get super passionate and angry about dinosaurs, and will fight one-another. One of the most famous instances of this were the Bone Wars (1877-1892) in which palentologists Othniel Marsh and Edward Cope intensley competed over fossil hunting and discovery. The rivals resorted to bribery, theft, and the destruction of fossils just to one-up each other.
